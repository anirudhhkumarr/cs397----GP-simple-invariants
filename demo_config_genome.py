"""
Example build on the demo_quadratic.py - understand that one first!

Program reads it's genome configuration from a config file (quadratic.ini)

Example config file:
[x1]
type = float
randMin = -100.0
randMax = 100.0
mutProb = 0.1
mutAmt = 0.1

[x2]
type = int
randMin = -50
randMax = 50
mutProb = 0.2
mutAmt = 1

[x3]
alias = x2

[x4]
type = float
value = 5.4

One section per gene.
'type' is necessary - other fields depends on the selected type
possible types (for current list see pygene/config.py):
int, int_exchange, float, float_exchange, float_random, float_max, complex
You can create a genes from previously specified ones using 'alias' field.

There might be available a special section 'population' with parameters
for population. It's never treated as a gene.
