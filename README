Overview:
--------

pygene is my attempt at a genetic algorithms
and genetic programming library
for python that is easy to use and understand

This is your chance to play God.

You design the genome of a species.

You implement a fitness calculation procedure
for members of that species.

You create a population of that species,
then sit back as members of the species indulge
their promiscuous desires.

A given organism's chance of getting laid is proportional
tno its fitness.

Watch as your population evolves closer and closer
to perfection, or converges to something reasonably close
to it.

Examples:

There are some examples in the toplevel directory, including:
 - Travelling Salesman Problem (console and graphical versions)
 - simple converger
 - string guesser
 - function deriver (genetic programming)
