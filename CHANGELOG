Changelog for pygene

July 25-26, 2011

    - version 0.2.2a

	- Fixed performance issue with calculating fitness.  Fitness is now
	  assumed to be stable for a generated organism.

	- prepare_fitness introduced to allow parallel processing
	  (demo_parallel.py)

	- Genome and population parameters can be defined in external ini-like
	  config file.

        - Minor performance/bugs fixes and whitespace cleanup

December 12, 2005

    - version 0.2.1

        - renamed Organism class to MendelOrganism, to indicate
          that it is based on a 'double-helix' eukaryotic model
        - created Organism class, which uses only single helix
          (single genes, not gene pairs)

December 11, 2005

    - version 0.2
        - added genetic programming!!
            - with working example
        - changed mutation behaviour
            - previously, child organisms were mutated in-place
            - now, .mutate() on organisms returns a mutated copy
        - changed crossover behaviour
            - previously, crossover mating only returned one child
            - now, crossover mating returns 2 children, so no
              genetic material is lost


December 9, 2005

    - version 0.1.1
        - added more primitive Gene subclasses
        - replaced typeless 'gene names' list in Organisms
          with a .genome dict
        - added XML dump capability for genes, organisms and
          populations
        - added 'incest' feature, where high-fitness parents
          can stay in the population and mate with their
          children
        - added option for spontaneous appearance of new
          random organisms
        - simplified the creation of random organisms
